* HAIS is an efficient and concise bottom-up framework for point cloud instance segmentation. It adopts the  hierarchical aggregation (point aggregation and set aggregation) to generate instances and the intra-instance prediction for outlier filtering and mask quality scoring.
* HAIS currently [ranks 1st](http://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/scannet_benchmark/semantic_instance_3d) on the [ScanNet benchmark](http://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/scannet_benchmark/semantic_instance_3d) and achieves the best inference speed among all existing methods (410ms per frame on average for large-scale point cloud containing hundreds of thousands of points).
